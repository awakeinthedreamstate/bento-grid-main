### üìù What I learned

My mojor learning from this project was how to use grid to create attractive layouts. Using grid, I was also able to create a responsive page that adjusted according to screen width by manipulating the arrangement of cards and numbers of rows and columns available within a pair of breakpoints. Flexbox also came in very handy for arranging the elements inside the cards to achieve the desired look. In future projects I will improve on using flexbox to properly size and arrange elements without much reliance on hard-coded values.
